      <ion-card-title>David Feherty - Live Off Tour</ion-card-title>
      <ion-card-subtitle>Monday, April 5, 2021 - 7:30 p.m.</ion-card-subtitle>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <ion-card-subtitle>This performance has been rescheduled to Monday, April 5, 2021 to correspond to 
        the Masters 2021.
        Your original tickets for the April 6, 2020 date will be valid for the new April 5, 2021 performance, 
        so hang on to them.</ion-card-subtitle>
      <p>How do you describe the offbeat antics of David Feherty? The New York Times called him "a cross between 
        Oprah Winfrey and Johnny Carson." With a sharp wit and irreverant style, the professional golfer turned 
        gold analyst, talk show host and sports broadcaster has made a name for himself as one of the most 
        hilarious and irrepressible personalities in golf. Of Feherty's live one-man show, Golf Digest said: 
        "Uncensored and unhinged, and worth the price of admission. It really was stupendous." The Pittsburgh 
        Post-Gazette raves, David Feherty was uproariously funny. It was two hours of zaniness and madcap 
        storytelling. People were coming out of their seats with laughter."</p>

      <ion-card-title>An Evening with Gregory Porter</ion-card-title>
      <ion-card-subtitle>Friday, June 25, 2021 - 7:30 p.m.</ion-card-subtitle>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <ion-card-subtitle>An Evening With GREGORY PORTER has been rescheduled to FRIDAY, JUNE 25, 2021. If you have 
        previously purchased tickets for the June 27, 2020 performance at the Koger Center for the Arts we ask that 
        you retain the tickets as they will be valid for the new date of June 25, 2021. (Please note this is one 
        year from the original concert date.)</ion-card-subtitle>
      <p>A big man with a big sound, Two-time Grammy Award winner, Gregory Porter has quickly
        become one of jazz’s most important male vocalists, a soul-drenched singer often at his best
        delivering his emotionally charged original songs. Largely unknown before his sensational,
        Grammy-nominated 2010 debut CD Water, Porter followed up with last year’s Be Good (both on
        Motéma Music), an album marked by his supple phrasing, sophisticated lyrics and tough but tender
        delivery.</p>
      <p>Born in Los Angeles and raised in the hardscrabble city of Bakersfield, Porter grew up with seven siblings 
        who all sang and worked in their mother’s skid row mission. He attended San Diego State on a football 
        scholarship, but after an injury he spent more time on the bandstand
        collaborating with top jazz artists than on the gridiron. A chance encounter led to Porter’s recording 
        debut on Hubert Laws Remembers the Unforgettable Nat King Cole, a 1998 album that earned him an audition for 
        the Broadway-bound musical “It Ain’t Nothin’ But the Blues.” Growing up around rollicking tent revivals 
        offered ideal training for a revue tracing the history of the blues, and he got the gig. Porter brings the 
        same soul-stirring authority to jazz settings, revealing powerful truths with heart and grace.</p>
